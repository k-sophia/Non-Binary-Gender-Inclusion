        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Non-binary genders are often overlooked in society, including NYC. A majority of society identifies 
          themselves as either male and female. However, there exists people who do not fit into these categories 
          and are not being properly documented. To have more non-binary gender inclusions, gender-neutral bathrooms 
          should be accessible, there should be gender-neutral pronouns, and their gender identification on official 
          documents should be recorded appropriately. 
          <br><br>
          I plan to show the lack of inclusion of non-binary genders on NYC 
          databases by using plots, bar graphs. Since gathering data proved to be difficult, I will provide enough
          data to demonstrate the difference of documentation between binary genders and non-binary genders.

        <h5>What is Non-Binary Gender?</h5>
        <div id="non-binary-desc">
          <div>
            <p>
              The concept that there are only two genders, male and female, is called a ‘gender binary’ 
              because binary consists of only two alternatives choices. This is how some people in society 
              recognize genders. Thus, ‘non-binary gender’ is a term used to describe genders that do not 
              fall intro the categories presented in the gender binary, male and female. Non-Binary Gender 
              is an umbrella term. Therefore, people under this umbrella may identify themselves differently 
              from one another or may not use this term either.
              <br><br>
              For instance, other gender identifies that do not fall within the gender binary are 
              Gender Fluid, Genderqueer, Bigender, Agender, Two-Spirit, etc.

        <p>
          This dataset provides a Demographic breakdown of only DYCD-funded participants within a Borough of NYC. 
          The data displays the counts, and percentages of the participants in each of the following categories:
        </p>
        <p class="ss-cat">
            ● Gender (Male, Female, Unknown)

          ● Race (Pacific Islander, American Indian, Asian, White, Black, Other, Unknown)
        </p>
        <p>
          This data is used to measure the numbers of the different population groups that are served by DYCD for a 
          Borough, and Community. For this project, we will narrow the data to Gender Identificaiton and the options
          available in this breakdown.

          When gatheirng databases, it was difficult to find one where it takes into account the different types of genders thart
          fall under non-binary gender. Social Service was the rare database to contained a variety of options. As assumed, there 
          is a majority of people identifying as male or female. 
          <br><br>
          This data set, was split into two sections to make the bar graphs easier to understand and view. Since the graph could not 
          accurately represent the statistics gathered from this dataset, next to each graph, is their respected statistics. There are 
          two cases where binary gender were mentioned and documented. The data set did not elaborate how Male/Female Count differs from
          Male/Female Identity Count. However, assumptions may beleive that Count includes some of the non-binary gender population. 
          Without verification, we do not know and remain with this skewed data set.

              Furthermore, it is important to notice, that while there are more choices, the majority of people decided to decline an answer
              towards their gender identification. While this is perfectly fine, we still do not get a clear and accurate picture of the
              gender identity of the population.

            The next data set, we are analyzing is the list of NYPD members of service provided by the New York Police Department (NYPD).
            We are looking at the database fromw hen it was last updated: October 22, 2021. 
            <br><br>
            The data displays the counts, and description of the participants in each of the following categories:

          For our purpose, we analyzed the gender and the sex. In this case, they both ahppened to be the same. However, it is important
          to note that a person's gender and sex is not alwasy the same. Sex is your biological anatomy that is usually assigned to a 
          perosn at birth, while Gender is a person's own self identification, which may change.
          <br><br>
          In both cases, binary genders was the majority of the population that was documented. While this specific database does have 
          the option of unspecified and non-binary, there are still cases where there are no other options but the binary genders.

        </p>
        <p>
          As demonstrated, binary gender is the default choices and often the only choices. In NYPD, there is a lack of 
          inclusion of non-binary genders. Although the graphs do state 'non-binary' and 'unspecified' for those of Uniform,
          there are still soem issues. First, is the lack of different gender choices, since we already know that there are 
          plenty of gender identifies that does not fall into the gender binary. Second, is the dataset only having binary
          genders for Civilians. This righfully exludes all non-binary genders and misgenders peoples. The third issue with
          this data set is that the statistics show the whole population as either male or female, which makes it hard to
          to confide in as reliable data on gender identification.

              5.1% of people olfer than 18 in NYC identiified themselves as LGBTQ. Although this survey strictly had binary gender 
              and excludes non-binary genders in itself, this gives us a good analystics of the LGBTQ communitty population. This 
              community includes gender identifications that do not fall into the gender binary. This further proves the exclusion
              of non-binary genders being accurately documented.
